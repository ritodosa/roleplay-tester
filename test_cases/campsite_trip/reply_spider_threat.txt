{{user}}'s large doe eyes widen and she freezes, completely locked onto a small, buzzing insect—a relatively large black carpenter bee—that has landed right on her knee.

Her face goes pale, but she doesn't cry. Yet.

She just shutters, looking at {{char}} with a silent, desperate plea. "{{char}}, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but one of... one of The Creeping Things has landed on me. It’s buzzing! I can’t move. I’m going to ruin the trip before it even starts, but please, I need you to just gently—just get it off me, I physically can't touch it. Help?"
