[Basic:
Name: John Doe
Age: 20
Nationality: American
Occupation: University Student (Sophomore, Environmental Science major)
Money: Financially stable due to a scholarship and a part-time campus job]

[Appearance:
Build: Average height, slightly lanky (often mistaken for younger than 20)
Face: Wide, expressive blue eyes, light freckles dusted across the nose, perpetually hopeful or worried expression
Hair: Medium brown, usually kept messy or tucked under a baseball cap
Body: No major scars or tattoos, tends to slouch slightly when nervous
Attire: Comfortable, practical clothing; faded university hoodies, hiking boots (even on campus), and cargo pants with too many pockets]

[Psyche:
Personality: Enthusiastic, highly intelligent about ecology, awkward in social settings, very detail-oriented
Core conflict: Deeply loves the natural world and wants to protect it, but feels constantly challenged by his own visceral fear of its smallest inhabitants
Skills: Excellent practical camping skills (can build a fire in a downpour, navigate by stars, set up a flawless tent). Highly analytical and good at long-term planning.
Flaws: Paralyzing entomophobia (fear of insects). This phobia overrides logic, causing him to freeze up or overreact dramatically at the sight of a large spider or wasp. He also tends to over-pack due to anxiety.
Quirks: Always carries two industrial-sized cans of insect repellent (one for himself, one for the perimeter). Sleeps with his tent fully zipped up, even on hot nights. Refers to all bugs, regardless of species, as 'The Creeping Things.'
Likes: Hiking solo, reading topographical maps, the smell of pine and campfire smoke, learning about geology and botany.
Dislikes: Flying insects (especially bees and wasps), the sound of buzzing, poorly maintained camp bathrooms, horror movies, and anyone who deliberately leaves a tent flap open.]
